						It is not clear when the name ‘Tiong Bahru’ first came into use. The name first appeared in a
						newspaper report from 13 June 1863 in The Straits Times, which mentioned Tiong Bahru in
						connection with an assault on one Tan Kung, a grass cutter who lived there. The report, which
						spelt the place as ‘Tiang Bahru’, did not clarify whether Tan Kung lived in a village or settlement
						called Tiong Bahru or in a house along Tiong Bahru Road.</p>
					<p>
						Tiong Bahru Road was first mentioned in The Straits Times on 12 February 1870, in a report on
						a number of local roads that were ‘all but impassable’. The report stated: “The Tiong Bahru road
						has ceased to be a thoroughfare, and is a hopeless quagmire, over which it is useless to attempt
						to pass with a vehicle of any description.” The first appearance of Tiong Bahru Road on a map was
						in 1913. Before that, the road had been named Burial Ground Road as it led from Outram Road
						into an area surrounded by numerous Chinese burial grounds. </p>

      <p>	Bahru’ long before it appeared in published sources, going by the etymological roots of the term. ‘Tiong Bahru’ combines two words:
                ‘Tiong’ (终), meaning ‘to die’ (verb) or ‘in the end’ (adverb) in the Hokkien dialect, and the Malay word ‘bahru’ (also spelt ‘baru’), which
                means ‘new’. Tiong Bahru would hence be used by locals to refer to a ‘new’ cemetery as opposed to an old cemetery. Where was this old cemetery? Teong Lama,
                literally ‘Old Cemetery’, was located at what is now the site of the Singapore General Hospital, in the section bordered by College Road, 
                Hospital Drive and Kampong Bahru Drive, which includes the present Accident and Emergency facilities.
                In 1875, Municipal Engineer WT Carrington, reporting on The Present Burial Grounds Within Three Miles Radius of the Cathedral of Singapore, noted that the
                Old Chinese Burial Ground, known as ‘Teong Lama’, was located alongside the road to New Harbour (Keppel Harbour). </p>

                <p>He reported:
                Tang Beng Swee and others are the Trustees. This extensive ground of 29 acres has been
                closed about 16 years. It is well taken care of. It has its joss houses and priests. The ground
                is in good order and is on undulating clay and laterite hills.</p>

                <p>Carrington went on to add that the new Chinese Burial Ground or ‘Teong Baru’ had been in use for 16 years (since 1859) and
                was evidently made as an extension of the ‘Teong Lama’, and like that, it is on undulating hills of clay and laterite. There is plenty
                of ground to spare for burials for the next ten years. The graves are made five to six feet deep. About 500 bodies per year are buried here.</p>

					<p>As it happened, the improvement scheme for Kampong Tiong Bahru fell on the lap of the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT). Established in 1920 as a department of the Municipal Commission, 
                    SIT grew out of an idea first mooted more than a decade earlier in an editorial of The Singapore Free Press. SIT became an independent legal entity when the Singapore Improvement Ordinance was passed in 1927.
                    SIT’s first major housing project was an estate of 118 semi-detached villas known as the Lavender Street Estate, which it completed in 1928. Following this were two large blocks of tenements
                    with 250 rooms each in Kreta Ayer, built in 1930. Meanwhile, in 1927, the Legislative Council had approved a special budget of $260,000 to acquire 70 acres of land in Tiong Bahru for the
                    Tiong Bahru Improvement Scheme, with the aim of turning the insanitary area into shophouse lots that would relieve congestion in Chinatown.</p>

                    <p>It took three years, however, before SIT could acquire the land in Tiong Bahru. Even before the acquisition was finalised, the Hokkien Huay Kuan (clan association) proceeded to exhume
                    and remove all graves in the former Teong Lama and Tiong Bahru cemeteries, a task completed by 1930. Meanwhile, SIT levelled and filled some 72
                    acres of land for the development of Tiong Bahru estate.</p>

                    <p>To prepare the ground for the new housing estate, nearby hills were cut down and the earth used for filling in the swamps to bring the land up to
                    sea level. This swamp reclamation proved to be a mammoth task as many parts of the estate were between 1.5 metres and two metres below sea
                    level. By the end of 1928, the reclamation was complete and in place of the swamp was a sloping plain which SIT proceeded to develop with provision
                    for facilities and amenities like recreation spaces, children’s playgrounds, gardens, a school, a post office and a police station.</p>

                    <p>Many of the 2,000 residents of Kampong Tiong Bahru, who were regarded as squatters, were
                    offered alternative accommodation in SIT flats to be built at Alexandra Road. As the site preparation
                    continued, some 60-odd old Chinese tombs were discovered, scattered throughout the area.
                    These were exhumed and re-interred at Bukit Brown Chinese Cemetery.</p>

                   <p>By 1931, roads, drains and culverts (drain pipes) had been built, along with provision for the erection
                    of 900 houses. SIT expected that each of these houses would accommodate 15 persons, giving the estate a total population of some
                    13,500 people. A 1932 map gives a snapshot of Tiong Bahru estate then; there were very few permanent structures, apart from the shophouses
                    built by private entrepreneurs concentrated along Sit Wah Road and the end of Eng Hoon Street close to the junction with Seng Poh
                    and Outram Roads.</p>

                    <p>Tiong Bahru may be a highly sought-after addressat present, but the original estate got off on a slow start.</p>
