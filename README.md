User Goals:  
 Target Group of User:

with relevant calls to action (booking, reservation, purchase, leads gathering).

**UX**   
The website is created so that tourists need only go to one website to search   
for details of Tiong bahru and the surrounding place of interest.    
It also provides information about the place, curated trails, hotel information   
and also a map which can help with finding food and restaurants in the vicinity. 

As the website is supposed to be information heavy, so the website is such that   
it has demarcated segments, so that loading of information is only related to what
they are interest in. It focuses more on visual display and information is hidden
to prevent information overload. 

The theme is tertiary brown to maintain a feel of nostalgia and to communicate that 
even though Tiong Bahru is a hippy place it has historical roots. 
The carousel feature, enables viewers to see the related activities through an interactive display. 

**UI**
Nav Bar is fixed and at the top, to provide an anchoring point for users when the visit site. 
The sections of the Nav Bar helps users navigate through the site. 
The format of the site is conventional, so that users can focus on the information presented 
as we would want them to use it when on the move.
